Nevertheless, Bruce Wayne is the primary Batman in most iterations of the character. The secret identity of Batman is an important aspect of how he is perceived by villains and criminals on the streets of Gotham. His anonymity provides security and safety for those in his personal life, and it also enhances the influence of <strong>fear and intimidation</strong> on his foes. </p>
